o# Proyecto Final Sistemas Embebidos 1er Semestre 2021

This code is the kick-off Final Prject of the Embedded System course at Universidad Católica del Uruguay.

The .X directory corresponds to a MPLAB X IDE project. It contains a fully functional port of freeRTOS v9 for PIC32MM devices, particularly for PIC32MM0256GPM064 which is used at our course. Also it includes some hardware definitions using the Microchip Code Configurator (MCC) tool based on the Development Board used at class.
This code is tested under the following configurations:
* MPLAB X IDE v5.35
* XC32 Compiler v2.40
